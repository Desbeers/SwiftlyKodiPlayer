# SwiftlyKodiPlayer

## An extension for [SwiftlyKodiAPI](https://github.com/Desbeers/swiftlykodiapi) 

Experiment for AVplayer alternatives; currently [KSPlayer](https://github.com/kingslay/KSPlayer).

- AVPlayer is limited to *Apple Appproved Formats*. I want a bit more freedom and a bit more control.
- SwiftUI `VideoPlayer' is even worse...

In use for [Komodio](https://github.com/Desbeers/Komodio); my tvOS application to stream videos from a Kodi host written in SwiftUI 4.
